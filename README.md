# Python for Biochemistry: Data Analysis Tutorial Series

This is a beginner-friendly tutorial series designed to help biochemistry and life science students learn Python for data analysis. Each Jupyter Notebook introduces a popular Python library using real or realistic bioscience examples — including enzyme kinetics, protein concentration, and gene expression.

## What's Included

| Chapter | Library | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | NumPy | Work with numerical data and arrays |
| 02 | pandas | Organize and analyze tabular lab data |
| 03 | matplotlib | Create basic scientific plots |
| 04 | seaborn | Make beautiful statistical graphics |
| 05 | SciPy | Curve fitting, t-tests, ANOVA, and more |
| 06 | scikit-learn | Machine learning for classification and clustering |
| 07 | statsmodels | Linear models and statistical summaries |
| 08 | Biopython | Sequence and bioinformatics tools |
| 09 | plotly | Interactive visualizations |
| 10 | SymPy | Symbolic math for equations and rate laws |

## How to Use
