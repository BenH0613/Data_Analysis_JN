
#  Welcome to Python for Biochemistry

This interactive textbook introduces you to Python programming through real bioscience examples. You don’t need any prior coding experience — just curiosity and a basic understanding of lab data.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use Python to clean, analyze, and visualize experimental data
- Which libraries are best for specific bioscience tasks
- How to build simple models like linear regression and clustering

## Real-World Applications

Each chapter includes a hands-on example based on biochemistry, such as:

- Tracking enzyme activity over time
- Analyzing protein concentrations from ELISA
- Fitting curves to reaction data
- Exploring genetic sequences with Biopython
- Classifying samples with machine learning

## How to Use This Book

- Work through the chapters in order, or skip to the tools you need.
- Run each code cell to see the output.
- All explanations are written for absolute beginners.
